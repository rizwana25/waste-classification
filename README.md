# 🗑️ Waste Classification using Machine Learning

This project is a **Flask web application** that classifies waste images into categories such as cardboard, compost, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. It uses a **TensorFlow Lite model** for lightweight, efficient inference and is deployed on **Render**.  

🌍 **Live Demo:** [Waste Classification App](https://waste-classification-3.onrender.com)  

---

## 📌 Features
- Upload an image of waste and get a predicted category.  
- Displays prediction confidence.  
- Built with **Flask**, **TensorFlow Lite**, and **NumPy**.  
- Frontend built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
- Deployed on **Render** (free tier).  

---

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **[Multi-class Garbage Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishallazrus/multi-class-garbage-classification-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** from Kaggle.  

- The dataset contains images organized in folders by class.  
- Classes include: `cardboard`, `compost`, `glass`, `metal`, `paper`, `plastic`, and `trash`.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Model:** TensorFlow Lite (pre-trained CNN model)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Deployment:** Render (Python Web Service)

## 🌐 Deployment (Render)

1. Push your project to GitHub.
2. On [Render](https://render.com/):

   * Create a new **Web Service**.
   * Connect your GitHub repo.
   * Build command:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   * Start command:

     ```bash
     ./start.sh
     ```
3. Add a `runtime.txt` file to specify Python version:

   ```
   python-3.11.8
   ```
