Waste Classification Project 🌍♻️
Overview

Improper waste management contributes to pollution, landfill overflow, and resource wastage. This project uses Deep Learning to classify images of waste into 7 categories:

Plastic, Paper, Glass, Metal, Cardboard, Bio, and Trash.

The model helps in automating waste segregation, promoting efficient recycling, and supporting sustainable environmental practices.
